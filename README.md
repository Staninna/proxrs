⚠️ **This project is currently broken and non-functional on the `main` branch.** ⚠️

However, a re-write of the entire project is currently underway on the [`re-write`](https://github.com/Staninna/proxrs/tree/re-write) branch. If you would like to contribute to the project, you can make a pull request to the [`re-write`](https://github.com/Staninna/proxrs/tree/re-write) branch. Alternatively, if you want to fix the `main` branch to a working state, you can also make a pull request to that branch.

## What is Proxrs?

Proxrs is a reverse-proxy server written in Rust, intended to require user login before accessing a website. This is achieved through the use of sessions and cookies.
