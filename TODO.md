## Maybe

- Fancy error messages with colors and stuff (like [`color_eyre`](https://docs.rs/color-eyre/latest/color_eyre/) or something similar)

## Todo

- [ ] Use `axum` for the project cause it seems easier to use than raw `hyper` and `tower`.
  - Example: <https://github.com/ddprrt/axum-tower-layer-services/>
